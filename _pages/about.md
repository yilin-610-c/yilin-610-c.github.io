Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi, Yilin Liu (刘奕麟) there! You can also call me Caralyn.

I'm a junior at <a href='https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/'>HKUST(GZ)</a> majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology, currently a Visiting Student at UC Berkeley (Fall 2025).

My research journey began under the supervision of **[Prof. Jiaheng Wei](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/jiahengwei)**, where I joined a project on **Agentic Data Synthesis** to tackle the scarcity of high-quality reasoning data. While building this application, I confronted the fundamental bottlenecks of model inference and memory costs. This drove my interest down the stack—from high-level agents to the **underlying model architecture** and **system optimization**. Moving forward, I will be conducting research on **LLM Acceleration** and **High-Performance Computing** under the guidance of my academic advisor, **[Prof. Zeyi Wen](https://zeyiwen.github.io)** at HKUST(GZ).

I am now actively looking for **Research Internships (Summer 2026)** to optimize how we train, evaluate, and scale the next generation of AI models.

For more details about my background and projects, please check out my [CV](/cv/).
