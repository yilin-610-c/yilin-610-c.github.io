As one of the main wet lab contributor, I spearheaded the design of a key circuit part and conducted intensive wet lab experiments. I was responsible for the end-to-end experimental process, from designing protocols and executing complex assays to maintaining comprehensive documentation.","highlights":["Sythetic Biology","AI for Science"],"startDate":"2024-2","endDate":"2024-10","url":"https://2024.igem.wiki/hkust-gz"}],"work":[],"interests":[{"name":"Efficient ML","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Training Acceleration","Inference Acceleration"]},{"name":"Data-Centric AI","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Synthetic Data Generation","Data Selection & Pruning"]},{"name":"Agentic Systems","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Multi-agent Collaboration","Tool Usage"]}],"skills":[{"name":"Programming Languages","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Python","C++","C","Bash"]},{"name":"Research Techniques","level":"","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Experimental Design","Data Analysis and Visualization","Model Training and Evaluation"]}],"volunteer":[{"organization":"HKUST(GZ) Global Affairs Department","location":"","position":"Student Journalist","url":"","startDate":"2024-09","endDate":"Present","summary":"Participated in filming and producing various campus videos to promote university events and enhance the public image of HKUST(GZ).","highlights":[" <a href='https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Hw3Lz4EyH/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=96d477b909d9269f34c545c2846f0d0d' target='_blank'>Check out a dormitory tour video I co-filmed here!</a>"]}],"certificates":[],"publications":[],"languages":[{"language":"Chinese","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""}],"references":[]}
